# ************   Instructions   *************
# For the default entries, they are formatted as follows:
# 
#       <number of items>-<amount of xp>. Disable them by setting the number of items to 0.
# 
# To add new smelting recipes, put items in the adding section in the format:
# 
#       <input item id>_____<metadata (-1 for any)>_____<output item id>_____<metadata>_____<NBT Tag ({} for blank)>_____<amount>_____<xp given (optional)>
# 
# For instance, if you want to add a recipe where smelting wool of any color gives you charcoal, you can add:
# 
#       minecraft:wool_____-1_____minecraft:coal_____1_____{}_____1_____1.0
# 
# Note that the nbt data is ignored for smelting recipes, which is why it isn't a parameter for the input item.
# 
# 
# To add new furnace fuel items, add them to the add_furnace_fuels section in the format:
# 
#       <fuel item id>_____<metadata (-1 for any)>_____<burn time>
# 
# For reference, a furnace operation takes a time of 200. Coal has a burn time of 1600.
